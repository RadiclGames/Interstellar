            In July 1947, something happened northwest of Roswell during a severe thunderstorm. Was it a flying saucer? Was it a weather balloon? What happened? <br><br>

            The answer is, nothing for many years, until leading UFO researcher Stanton Friedman came across the story in the early 1980s and began the search for information and witnesses. That research brought him to Roswell looking for the public information officer who had been at Roswell Army Air Field in 1947. That officer was Lt. Walter Haut. He still lived in Roswell and remembered the press release and the orders from his commanding officer. <br>

            Friedman's investigation also led to many others, both military and private, who had information to add to the Roswell Incident story. Stepping into the picture very strongly in the late 1980s were Don Schmitt, Kevin Randle and Tom Carey. since then, Schmitt and Carey have dedicated their research to Roswell. <br>

            The debris recovered by rancher WW Mack Brazel was gathered by the military from the Roswell Army Air Field under the direction of base intelligence officer Major Jesse Marcel. On July 8, 1947, public information officer Lt. Walter Haut issued a press release under orders from base commander Col. William Blanchard, which said basically that we have in our possession a flying saucer. The next day another press release was issued, this time from Gen. Roger Ramey, stating it was a weather balloon. That was the start of the best known and well-documented UFO coverup. <br><br>

            Once it became public, the event known as The Roswell Incident - the crash of an alleged flying saucer, the recovery of debris and bodies and the ensuing cover up by the military - was of such magnitude and so shrouded in mystery that, 70 years later, there are still more questions than answers. Books have been written and TV documentaries have been filmed. Witnesses have come forward. Skeptics have issued rebuttals to the Incident, and the debate continues.

            The International UFO Museum & Research Center, located at 114 N. Main Street, is a nonprofit corporation founded in the fall of 1991 by Walter Haut, Glenn Dennis and Max Littell. The museum opened to visitors in the fall of 1992. The UFO museum was organized to inform the public about what has come to be known as "The Roswell Incident" as well as all other aspects of the UFO phenomena. The corporation's mission statement includes the goal to educate, not convince, the general public about the Roswell Incident and all aspects of the UFO phenomena.

            People from all around the world travel to Roswell to what the UFO Museum has to offer. some of the exhibits include information on the Roswell Incident, crop circles, UFO sightings, ancient astronauts and extraterrestrial abductions. The exhibits are designed to encourage visitors to ask questions and to think outside the box.

            Once visitors began making their way to Roswell seeking more information on the 1947 Incident, a number of local residents, in conjunction with the UFO Museum and the Roswell Chamber of Commerce, came up with the idea of celebrating the anniversary of Roswell Incident every year during the first week of July. <br><br>

            Since 1996, the Roswell UFO Festival has drawn thousands of visitors to the UFO Museum and to Roswell.  The event is a fun-filled, entertaining and educational weekend for all who attend. <br><br>

            The UFO Museum hosts lectures from leading UFO researchers, including Stanton Friedman, Don Schmitt, Tom Carey, Kathleen Marden, Peter Robbins, Derrel Sims, Yvonne Smith and Travis Walton. MainStreet Roswell brings together numerous vendors along Main Street with food, memorabilia, music and live entertainment. Other activities include alien costume contests for humans and pets, an evening light parade, carnival rides and Fourth of July fireworks. Mark your calendars and make your plans to attend this popular tradition at one of the most celebrated tourist attractions in the nation - the International UFO Museum and Research Center in the city of Roswell, New Mexico.
